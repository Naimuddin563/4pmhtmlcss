Transition: transition means moving from one state to another state.
You can control transition of an element by 'transition' property.
transition: property time(s) timingFunction
property: provide which property to show transition or 'all'
time(duration): time in seconds or milliseconds
timingFunction: it defines the speed in which element moves from one state to another state

there are so many properties which can be applied for nice
 transition effects
